In any game, cricket football etc, a specific time limit has been provided to all the players and asked them to play and make a score in that limited time, and after that particular time game will be over. So player try to give their best performance In that given time so that they can win that match, suppose if they haven’t given a time limit and they were not informed about how many overs will be there in that particular match and they are asked to play as much they can, so what do you think, will that players play with the same energy enthusiasm power and intensity? No obviously they will not, because if they feel that they have lot of time and they can play whenever they want, so because of such reasons their motivation and focus will start diminishing, same thing happens with us, most people live their life as if it will never going to end, they feel they have lot of time, and they can do work later, and keep on pending work and important thing.

Listening to such things most of the people will not feel good, but do understand and accept the fact and reality, I am telling you all this, not to make you feel bad, but to make you accept the reality and to make you understand that you have limited time and so that you can achieve your dream and goal in this limited time, otherwise one day you will realize that now it’s too late to do anything.

If I keep a long thick wooden stick on the ground and ask you to walk on that stick, you will easily walk on that stick and cross it,  but if I keep that same wooden stick between two building at 20th floor, and then ask you to walk and cross that stick, doing that would really become difficult for you, you will be scared of doing that and there is a lot of chances that you even fall from that wooden stick before crossing it, why? Because focus is everything, when that wooden stick was on the ground at that time your focus was on that particular stick and on crossing that stick, but when that same wooden stick with same physics was kept between two building at 2oth floor, your focus shifts from that stick to the fear of falling down, and this shifting of focus becomes the actual reason of your falling down, similarly, reason for your lack of motivation is, instead of keeping a focus on an  achievement and success which you will get by doing a hard word, you shift it to problems, worries and to the failure to such negative things, which eventually decreases our motivation, and make us fall before crossing or completing that particular goal, hence try to keep your focus on that particular reward and success which you will get by doing hard work, and avoid focusing on failure and negative things.
